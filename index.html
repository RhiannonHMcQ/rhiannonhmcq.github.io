      <p>
        My name is Rhiannon! I'm an HCDE major and ASL minor. This is my 
        senior year, and I'm originally from West Seattle. This quarter, 
        I look forward to learning more about physical circuits, ASL, 
        and linguistics. Outside of school, I spend a lot of time reading,
        visiting family, and watching shows with my friends.
